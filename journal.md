# Week 1 - Make A Thing: The Tomb of Many Ends

## Initial Brainstorm
First, I knew that I wanted to use Twine because I had never used it before but it seemed really interesting and fun. Then, I tried brainstorming a theme/idea/story to try to implement in Twine. I kept going back to theme's I had already tried before and didn't like any of them because I really wanted to try something new. I ended up using a topic randomizer website until I found something that inspired me. I saw the word Mummy and instantly thought of Indiana Jones and thought of like old tomb exploration and so that is what I went with. Knowing that the goal was not to make something perfect but simply to make something complete helped me commit to an idea and move forward. 

This was a theme but I wanted to add a somewhat interesting mechanic and since I am the type of player that wants to interact everything, I thought it could be fun to play with that. I decided to add a "curiosity level" which increases based on what you interact with and what you do. Different curiosity levels allow for different endings and possible interactions.

## Core Concept 
The final concept became a short interactive game set inside a tomb that reacts to the player’s curiosity. The core mechanic is a curiosity variable that increases when the player chooses to investigate objects, touch things, or explore deeper into the tomb. Rather than using combat or an inventory system, the game relies on choice-based progression and changing tone. The tomb itself becomes an observing presence that “remembers” the player’s actions and responds accordingly through text and events.

## Curiosity Level 
One of my main design goals was to make the experience somewhat counter-intuitive for certain players. As someone who typically wants to interact with everything in games, I found it interesting to design a system where curiosity is not always rewarded. High curiosity can lead to negative endings, such as being killed by the tomb or the snake, while more restrained play can result in safer outcomes. At the same time, high curiosity can also unlock a secret ending, where surviving the snake encounter leads to a hidden tunnel and a special reward. This allowed curiosity to feel risky rather than strictly good or bad.

I was able to create different endings and interactions based on "curiosity level" with lines like this:
 <<if $curiosity > 2 and $curiosity < 7>>
 [[...->Tomb1]]
 <</if>>

## Exploration and Learning 
Because this was my first time using Twine, much of the process involved learning how the tool works, especially how to use variables, conditionals, and passage structure in SugarCube. I found Twine to be surprisingly flexible and well suited for creating branching narratives and multiple endings with minimal mechanics. It allowed me to focus on writing, pacing, and player choice without needing complex systems. 

## Reflection
Overall, this project helped me become more comfortable working quickly, experimenting with unfamiliar tools, and accepting imperfection in early prototypes. Working within such a short timeframe forced me to prioritize finishing something playable rather than over-polishing individual elements. This helped reduce my usual tendency to get stuck refining ideas instead of moving forward.
Using Twine for the first time also changed how I thought about game structure. Because the tool is text-based and relatively simple, it encouraged me to think more carefully about player choice, pacing, and consequence rather than relying on complex mechanics. I found that even small systems, like a single curiosity variable, could meaningfully shape the player’s experience and lead to multiple outcomes.
Moving forward, I’m interested in continuing to experiment with simple mechanics that have layered narrative consequences, as well as expanding on some of the ideas introduced in this game, such as environmental storytelling and multiple endings. 
I am pretty proud of the end result and I think it is an interesting Make A Thing project. One way I thought about improving it would be to simply add music to create a slightly more immersive experience.
